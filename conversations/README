$ ruby crawl.rb > progress.log 2> mentions.tsv 

let run until bored
~12hours gives 300e3 records in mentions.tsv (8e3 ppl processed)

$ pig -x local -p input=mentions.tsv -p output=conversations.tsv extract_conversations.pig

takes 14s to 160e3 conversations



todo
- change to rest api so can use whitelisting

problems
- rate limiting means tweets gathered later and quite different in time to the ones first collected, not good for conversations
- search api doesnt return very many results per person, api could dig deeper in time
