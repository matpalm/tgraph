todo: plot a dendogram in R? ggplot2? 

community detection using the
 1) 
	simple
		take nearby twitter graph,
		prune to only two way relationships
		extract cliques, are there any?
	test
		12 nodes from p77

 1.5) current work-in-progress approach
  shortest paths
  remove maximal edge
  decompose in connected components using tarjans strongly connected components.  
  
 2) build similarity of vertices;
  s(A,B) = methods like (p86)
         = |shortest_dist(A,B)| + |shortest_dist(B,A)| (p87)
	and perform hierarchical clustering,
  draw a dendogram from this clustering, is there an "obvious" visible cut point?
 
 3) garvin newman

 4) clique percolation method 

test set
 3 subgraphs; like p77

how to get a ga to solve this?
representation?
 representation can just be a sequence of length n (n nodes) with each gene representing
 the cluster the node belongs to
  
some fitness functions defined on p85
 - the internal degree of a subgraph exceeds its external degree

how to represent, and calc fitness for, fuzzy cluster membership
