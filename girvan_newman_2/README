when more than one partition only remove one edge per iteration, not one per subgraph
this only matters if you want an accurate dendogram

stocastic g-n (p98) using a few random points to calc betweenness rather than all vertices
have to run a number of times but each time is a vote towards what community so is
effectively giving a probability distribution
