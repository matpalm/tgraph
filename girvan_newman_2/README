impl of girvan newman network decomposition
edge betweeness implemented using stochstatic all shortest paths

see parent README for notes on using it

stocastic g-n (p98) using a few random points to calc betweenness rather than all vertices
have to run a number of times but each time is a vote towards what community so is
effectively giving a probability distribution
